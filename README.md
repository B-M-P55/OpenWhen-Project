OpenWhen - Emotional Support App

Description
OpenWhen is a simple, heartfelt Windows Forms application designed to provide emotional support and encouragement when youâ€™re feeling various emotions. Users can select categories like "HAPPY," "SAD," or "other emotions," read inspiring messages, write down their feelings before and after reading, and save their responses for later reflection.

The app says, "If you feel something, OpenWhen is always here!" and helps users process emotions with quotes from notable figures.

Features
Emotional Categories: Choose from 9 feelings (e.g., "HAPPY," "SAD," "STRESSED") to receive personalized, warm messages.
Save Entries: Write and save how you feel before and after reading each message in a text file.
View Entries: See all saved responses in a dedicated form.
User-Friendly Design: Features a soothing peach background with white buttons and text boxes.
